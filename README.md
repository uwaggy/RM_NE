Justification of Chosen Technologies
Spring Boot: Chosen for rapid application development due to its convention-over-configuration approach, embedded server, and auto-configuration features. It significantly reduces boilerplate code and speeds up the development process, aligning with the project's time constraints.
Spring Data JPA: Selected for simplified database access. It provides an abstraction layer over JPA providers (like Hibernate) and allows for defining repository interfaces that Spring Data automatically implements, minimizing manual data access code. This fits well with the task of designing the database and generating APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability, robustness, and performance. It's a suitable choice for an ERP system that requires data integrity and scalability.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for implementing stateless authentication and authorization. It's a standard and secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object, which is ideal for RESTful APIs where session state is not maintained on the server. This directly addresses the requirement for JWT-based security.
Spring Security: The standard framework for building secure Spring applications. It provides comprehensive security services, including authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities. Integrated with JWT to secure the API endpoints based on roles.
Springdoc OpenAPI: Chosen for generating API documentation using the OpenAPI 3 specification. It integrates seamlessly with Spring Boot and automatically generates interactive documentation (Swagger UI) from the code, fulfilling the requirement to document APIs with Swagger UI.
Lombok: A utility to reduce boilerplate code for Java classes (like getters, setters, constructors, etc.) using annotations, making the code cleaner and more concise.
